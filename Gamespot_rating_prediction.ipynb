    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people play games. These games could be something like an adventure game, an action game or just a simple puzzle game. Everyone has their own taste in what games they like, but pretty much everyone agrees that the game that they want to play has to be good and fun to play. For this reason game reviews exist. Game reviews are a way for the consumer to read up about a certain game they want to play and see if the game will be worth their time or not. These reviews usually go together with a numerical rating from 1 to 10 to show how good the game is, with 1 being the worst rating and 10 being the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what influences this rating? What factors affect the kind of rating a game gets? In this Notebook I will predict the rating of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the rating I will use game, review and release data collected from the [Gamespot API](https://www.gamespot.com/api/documentation#toc-0-0). Gamespot is a game review website that makes reviews done by professional game reviewers."

    "After merging all the data we are left with 18016 rows of data. This sounds pretty good but at a glance I can already see that games are present multiple times in my dataset. This could be because a game can be released in multiple regions and on multiple platforms. I also see that there are slight differences in the rating each time a game reoccurs. Maybe a review gets updated after some time. To resolve this issue I would have to check for duplicate data and remove them from the dataset.\n",

Considering the differences in rating per reoccurence of a game, this difference could also very well be because of a game getting a separate review per platorm, per region instead of it only being an updated review. If I were to remove duplicate rows based on name it could potentially weaken the impact of these two factors in my predictive model.\n",

    "There does not seem to be a bias present since most publishers have a nice spread of ratings. Some publishers however, pretty much only have ratings from 7 and up except for a few outliers. Whether this is a bias or just a streak of good games cannot be determined. Based on this information I would guess that games associated with the publishers that only get high ratings, are more likely to get a higher rating. I do not see this as a big problem for my predictive model so I will include these publishers in my prediction. I will include the outliers as well since it does not seem unrealistic for publishers to release a bad game from time to time."
